    content="This is my Week 2 assignment titled Design Principles.
    This assignment I am going to chose a few design principles that we have read about. This
    assignment is also to help practice using DOM breakpoints and web page responsive design
    principles.">

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <p>Perot Museum</p>

            <img src="images/contrast.png" alt="Welcome page with contrasting colors" class="first-img">
            <p>My Explanation</p>
            <p>The Perot Museum of natural history and science uses the element of contrast to catch your 
            eye as soon as you open their website. The black background with the bold white text, not to mention
            red as the accent color allows that block of the webpage to be the first thing your eye sees when you
            navigate to the website. They use the red block to the side of "We're Back!" and a red button to get
            more information about how to visit them so those will be the first things you look at. Then the hours
            and days in the bold white text between lets that be the next thing you look at. That is excellent web 
            design because it effectively controls where the user's eye goes without straining it.</p>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <p>Raytheon Technologies</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.rtx.com/our-company/our-values">Raytehon Website</a></p>
            <img src="images/alignment.png" alt="company values inline" class="second-img">
            <p>My Explanation</p>
            <p>Raytheon Technologies uses the alignment property to display its company values. They align the image 
            that goes with the logo to the center and the text to state what the value is and a small catch phrase for 
            it as justified to the left so it looks clean-cut and still has enough white space between the words and the 
            image to catch the viewer's eye. I've noticed this is a popular technique and rightfully so since it looks 
            clean, it draws the eye and allows the developer to help the viewer understand the importance of the content.</p>

            <h3>Law of Symmetry</h3>
            <p>Amazon</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon Website</a></p>
            <img src="images/week2fittslaw.png" alt="Amazon Shopping homepage" class="third-img">
            <p>My Explanation</p>
            <p>The law of symmetry is applied here with the shopping category boxes. When you first look at the page 
            you initially see that there is a grid of boxes. They look symmetrical on the page, meaning they are laid 
            out at equal distances from each other all throughout the page. Regardless of the size of the product, the 
            images inside the boxes all appear to be the same size as well so the user isn't distracted with any one 
            particular thing. I think Amazon uses this technique because they want to sell as much as possible and don't 
            necessarily have one particular product to promote.</p>
