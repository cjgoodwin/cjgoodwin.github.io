            <h2>Let's describe our target audience first</h2>
            <p>This site targets a wide range of individuals. It targets the 
                person who is always on the go from one side of town
                to the other. But it also targets the person who doesnâ€™t get 
                out of the house enough and needs a little weather encouragement 
                to muster up that extra bit of courage to get their shoes and 
                sunscreen on to go outside for a little while.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="two-personas-listed">
            <h2>What kind of persona's did I chose?</h2>
            <p>All target audience members should be familiar with the concept 
            of the general range for comfortable temperatures and also for how 
            to navigate through a simple web application. They are the busy, on
            the go type of person who just needs to know what's waiting for them
            outside at all times. The other person is just the person who is
            too afraid to step outside and needs the confidence of the weather
            to convince them to go outside and enjoy some fresh air.

            <h2>These are my five listed scenarios:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Late for Work! Oh no! You are late for work and need to know what to wear without spending much time looking.</li>
                <li>Vacation plans. Been working hard and need to know when will be a good time to go on vacation.</li>
                <li>Too scared to go outside. Been cooped up too long and are too afraid of the weather changing quickly and leaving them unprepared.</li>
                <li>Hear the city sirens and need to respond appropriately. The app will help you know if you need to evacuate or take cover.</li>
                <li>Weekend picnic plans with the family. Need a reliable source to help you know if you will be able to go on a picnic this weekend.</li>
