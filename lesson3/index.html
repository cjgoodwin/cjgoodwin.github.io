        <h1>The Plan for Rainy Cloud Spy</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section class="domain-container">
            <h2>Finding The Domain Name</h2>
            <p>I chose the domain name of rainycloudspy.net because I thought it
                fitting for a weather channel to consider themselves a spy for mankind
                when it comes to communicating with the clouds. The domain of .com was
                taken but this domain only costs $12/year! What a deal!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="logo-container">
            <h2>The Famous logo</h2>
            <img src="images/icon.png" alt="logo" class="example-logo">
            <p>I chose that logo from the website provided in the assignment
                instructions called iconfinder.com. I wanted a logo that of
                course included the rainy cloud found in the name but also showed
                a chance for sunshine like this one. I also wanted to chose a logo
                that would easily pop against the color theme that I chose for the
                site.
